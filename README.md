# Kbd34

Kbd34 started as a project to create a 12-keys keyboard, but it evolved
to become a keyboard creator application.

The objective is to have an application able to dynamically create a keyboard.
It should provide default implementation for a 12-keys keyboard, but be build
around an engine which read JSON files to store and build keyboards.
This way, any users should be able to:
- modify the mapping between characters and keys
- create its own custom keyboard
